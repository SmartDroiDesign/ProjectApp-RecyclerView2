# Recycler View Project 2

The project aims to master the Recycler View Pattern, and combine it with the use of external libraries.
The RecyclerView pulls texts and images into a CardView Layout. Items are clickable and open up in a new activitiy.
The new activity contains a bigger versino of the image and some text.

The external libraries used are:

Glide: https://github.com/bumptech/glide
CircleImageView: https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView
CardView: https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/cardview/widget/CardView.html
RecyclerView: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView
